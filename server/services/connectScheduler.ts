// Cross-connection outbound IRC (re)connect throttle. See issue #236.
//
// On a process (re)start the cell auto-connects every user's autoconnect
// networks in one synchronous burst (ircManager.initAll → startNetwork → a
// tight loop of conn.connect()). At cell density many of those land on the same
// IRC network (e.g. Libera) from one IP in the same tick — a burst of dozens of
// registrations that trips the server's registration-flood / per-IP throttle.
// That is bad-netizen behaviour, risks K-lines, and (because a connection that
// is refused before it registers gets NO auto-reconnect from irc-framework)
// can leave our own users silently disconnected until the next restart.
// irc-framework's per-connection backoff smooths ONE flapping link, not the
// herd, so this scheduler sits ABOVE the connections and spaces the cold-start
// / bulk-resume launches out.
//
// Model: a rate limiter, not a concurrency pool. We never await a connect's
// completion (the socket establishes asynchronously and may never register), so
// a true in-flight cap would leak slots. Instead we enforce a MINIMUM SPACING
// between successive launches — per destination host (the axis the remote
// throttles) plus a gentler global floor (so a 100-network cell doesn't fire
// 100 TLS handshakes in one tick and spike CPU on a small node). Each per-host
// wait gets random jitter so a synchronised herd de-synchronises.
//
// Defaults are effectively a no-op for a single-user standalone: the first
// launch to any given host fires immediately, and the global floor only spaces
// distinct hosts a few hundred ms apart. Only the 2nd+ launch to the SAME host
// within the window actually waits — which is exactly the cell-density case
// this protects.
//
// In-process and stateless across restarts by design: a restart is precisely
// when the throttle matters, so re-running cold-start from an empty scheduler
// is correct. No persistence, no worker threads.
